> Fork of [chaseconey/htaccess-tester](https://github.com/chaseconey/htaccess-tester) intended for testing the redirection rules for EMMO.

A simple Docker container with mod_rewrite enabled for testing all of your .htaccess needs.

This image currently supports the latest version of Apache 2.4 and uses the official [httpd image](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/) to do so.

## Usage

### Via Docker Hub (simple)

The easiest way to get your htaccess tester up and running is to pull the off-the-shelf image from Docker Hub and link the folder with your htaccess into the running container.

For example, if you had a directory that looked like this:

```
.
├── .htaccess
└── index.html
```

you could simply link the entire directory into the web root of the container like so:

```
docker build -t htaccess-tester .
docker run -p 8080:80 -v "$PWD:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs" htaccess-tester
```

and navigate via browser or some other client such as `curl` to [http://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

### Via Github/Docker Compose (more control)

For a little bit more control over the apache environment, you might just clone the repository locally and modify the `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml` to your liking.

To test your .htaccess, simply boot up your container, and add your rules. By default, you can hit the running container via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

* Boot container using compose

      `docker-compose up`

* Make edits to .htaccess

      `vim .htaccess`

* Test .htaccess by visiting expected url

      `curl -IL http://localhost:8080/emmo`

Any changes that are made to the `httpd.conf` will require a full rebuild of the image

```
docker-compose build --force-rm --no-cache --pull
```
